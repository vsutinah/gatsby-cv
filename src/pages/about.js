            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Data science was something I've heard in various conversations regarding the IT industry. Having the power to predict results, optimize processes and automate tasks piqued my interest. What made me jump into the rabbit hole were the potential applications that it has to improve our lifestyle.</p>

            <p>I have recently graduated with a Distinction average, and with it, I've managed to accomplish various things. From understanding and training different machine learning models, to analysing large datasets 
            and visualising them to offer innovative ideas, I have culminated the results of my 3-year learning with the development of a web app that applies all of the knowledge and skills I have obtained from learning about data science.</p>

            <p>Whilst learning more about data science, I have also dabbled in software development, which led me to design and develop simple web apps, both alone and with colleagues I've met. It also led me to discover that my true passion lies mainly in coding, development and designing apps.</p>

            <p>As such, I have decided to look for opportunities that would grant me industry experience to develop and maintain scalable apps. While doing so, I continue to work on my side projects that focus on using NodeJS and React to further hone my skills.</p>
